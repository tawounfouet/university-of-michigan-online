### 9. What must happen before a client can open a socket?

- [x] A server must be running that is listening for socket connections
- [ ] The server must allocate sufficient memory to handle any needed retransmissions
- [ ] The client must create a local file with the same name as the socket
- [ ] The client must be on the same system as the server
- [ ] The client must be in the same folder as the server

### 10. What port is used for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)?

- [ ] 119
- [ ] 80
- [ ] 420
- [x] 25
- [ ] 142

### 11. What port is used by default for Secure HTTP (https)?

- [ ] 142
- [ ] 119
- [ ] 80
- [x] 443
- [ ] 25

### 12. What is the topic of the Internet Engineering Task Force document RFC2616?

- [ ] RFC815
- [x] RFC792
- [ ] RFC1224

### 15. What is the purpose of `encode()` in the `socketl.py` code:

- [ ] To break the data into packets for network transmission
- [ ] To make sure that the web server properly recognizes the GET command
- [x] To convert the data to UTF-8 before sending
- [ ] To check if there is any data ready to send

### 16. What can't you see in the Browser Developer Mode for most browsers?

- [ ] The request and response headers for retrieved documents
- [ ] The browser Document Object Model (DOM)
- [ ] The HTTP response code (like 200 or 404) for each request
- [x] The code that runs in the server

### 17. In the sample `server.py` code, which function call actually waits for incoming socket connection requests?

- [ ] `recv()`

### 19. Which Python library makes it very easy to make HTTP requests from Python?

- [ ] re
- [ ] decode
